# Philosophy Zines

Printable zines containing the works of long-dead philosophers. As these are designed to be printed, you may notice the words gettin' real cozy with the bottom edge. This isn't something to really be worried about, as (unless you've done something heinous to your print settings) it will print with plenty of border space

When printing, make sure you're setting your printer to double-sided and binding on the short edge.
